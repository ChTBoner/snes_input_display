# Snes controller input display
![image info](images/snes_controller.png)

Displays your SNES input reading directly from the console data, built in Rust with [ggez](https://ggez.rs).

Completely compatible with the [RetroSpy](https://retro-spy.com) Skin format for Super Nintendo controllers.




## Requirements
### Software
- [QUsb2Snes](https://skarsnik.github.io/QUsb2snes/) or [SNI](https://github.com/alttpo/sni)
- Sd2Snes or FxPak Pro for original hardware

NOTE: Tested working with [snes9x-emunwa](https://github.com/Skarsnik/snes9x-emunwa), and [bsnes-plus](https://github.com/black-sliver/bsnes-plus.git) but NOT with the Default layout.

### Configuration File
A configuration file named "settings.toml" at this location (see below for details):
- Windows: %localappdata%\snes-input-display\
- MacOS: $HOME/Library/Application Support/snes-input-display
- Linux: $HOME/.config/snes-input-display

### Skins
Retrospy compatible skins. 

You can find great skins here: 
 - https://github.com/developwisely/squabbler-retrospy-nintendospy-skins
 - https://proximitysound.itch.io/skins

## Configuration

If no configuration file is found at startup, it will create a file with bogus values at the locations stated above, and exit. 

It will not work until all is correct in the configuration file.

Paths must be in between single quotes
```toml
[controller]
# input_config_path: Path to read for input memory addresses
input_config_path = 'D:\Documents\snes-input-display\inputs_addresses.json'
layout = "Default"

[skin]
# skins_path: Folder where all your Retrospy skins are stored
# skins_path = '/home/example/Documents/squabbler-retrospy-nintendospy-skins/skins'
skins_path = 'C:\Users\example\Documents\squabbler-retrospy-nintendospy-skins\skins'
# skins_name: Folder name of the skin you want to use
skin_name = "snes-super-famicom-squabbler"
# skins_theme = value of '<background name> you want to use, found in the theme's xml file'
# ex: <background name="Black" image="input-display-overlay-famicom.png" />
skin_theme = "Black"

```
A settings file example can be found [here](https://github.com/ChTBoner/snes_input_display)

### For Linux and MacOS

Dont forget to set the correct permission on the file to allow it to execute

```sh
$ cd /path/to/snes_input_viewer/folder
# Linux
$ chmod +x snes_input_display_linux_amd64
# MacOS
$ chmod +x snes_input_display_mac_amd64
```

## Game List Working with the Defaults layout
You should try with the Default Layout if you're on the Sd2Snes/FxPakPro. It will NOT work with an emulator
The F90718 address doesn't work on emulator.

If not working, you can try to figure it out with an Emulator like Bizhawk

- Aladdin
- Axelay
- Castlevania Dracula X
- Contra 3
- Double Dragon V
- F-Zero
- Fatal Fury 1, 2, Special
- Final Fight 1, 2 and Guy (Not Final Fight 3)
- Illusion of Gaia
- Killer Instinct
- Lufia II - Rise of the Sinistrals
- Lufia, The Fortress of Doom
- Mortal Kombat 1, 3 (Not 2)
- NBA JAM (included Tournament Edition)
- NBA Live 95, 96, 97, 98
- NBA Showdown
- Secret of Mana
- Super Castlevania IV
- Super Ghouls n'Ghosts
- Super Mario Kart
- Super Mario World
- Super Metroid
- The Blues Brothers
- The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past
- The Lion King
- SMZ3 Randomizers
- ...

This list is in no way complete.
Please tell me games that also work so I can add them to the list or if you figure out other layouts

Will not work with Super FX and SA-1 games. (Star Fox, Yoshi's Island...).

### Controller config file

The controller config file must be in the json format

```json
{
    "layouts": {
        "Default": {
            "address_low": "F90718",
            "address_high": "F90719"
        },
        "Super Mario World": {
            "address_low": "F50DA4",
            "address_high": "F50DA2"
        },
        "Ninja Gaiden Trilogy": {
            "address_low": "F5127A",
            "address_high": "F5127B"
        }
    }
}
```

You can add addresses to the file for your game if needed.
The RAM Search tools of Bizhawk are great to find the values.

## TROUBLESHOOTING
SNI or QUSB2SNES must be up and running and connected to a powered on console.

Make sure all paths and info are correct in the configuration file.
